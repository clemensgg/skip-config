# Skip config
This repository contains version-controlled config values for Skip-enabled blockchains

We track values for: 
* `RELAYER_RPC_STRING`: Used by searchers 
* `RELAYER_PEER_STRING`: Used by full nodes to peer with our relayer over native gossip mechanisms
* `MEV_TENDERMINT_VERSION`: Version of mev-tendermint expected by the chain 
For instructions to get started with Skip as a searcher or a validator, [please see our docs](https://docs.skip.money).
